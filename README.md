# Hello_World
My first repository for class DSC520
My name is Saima Rahmanzai and I am an IT Audit Director. In addition to IT Audit, I am developing a Data Analytics program 
for the Audit Department.  I also audit the Enterprise Data Management group that creates models and use Machine Learning.  They use languages like Python and R.  Learning these languages will help audit understand even better the working of the models and understand how they are maintained and the governance structure around them.
